I recently (rather late!) downloaded the most recent 
RF24 library and updated my radio control project. 
The transmitter worked perfectly and immediately 
without any code changes. But when I updated the 
receiver code, it only partially worked with lots 
of extra lost packets. So I reverted the receiver 
to the older library which fixed it immediately. 
I am puzzled!
Today I ran some tests with the new library in 
the receiver code: I increased the packet count 
between channel hops massively. This reduced 
error rate by a similar proportion. So it’s 
clearly changing channel that’s the cause. But 
why and how to fix it is a mystery. If anyone 
has a clue I’d really appreciate it!
